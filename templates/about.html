      <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 30px;">College Index is an locally-hosted Flask web-app designed for easy access to other students' opinions and reviews of various universities. While it is meant for use by Kehillah students only, it is capable of hosting other users as well, with a verification system to eliminate spamming and trolling. If you would like to help develop this site, the source code is available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Ben1152000/CollegeIndex">github</a>.</p>
